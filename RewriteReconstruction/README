This experiment is meant to compare the time for reconstruction of a rewrite step in a proof for:

a) Reconstruction using the lemmas generated by IsaRARE
b) Reconstruction by Isabelle's simplifier

The workflow is as follows (run on cluster if possible):

0. Set CVC5_HOME, ISABELLE_HOME and AFP_HOME in config

1. Identify a set of benchmarks and put it into the Benchmark folder.
   Note: For memory reasons (the script will generate a new problem and proof for every rewrite) only a small batch of benchmarks is processed in one round
   Note: Isabelle cannot parse all of SMT-LIB, specifically it cannot deal with the | | feature, i.e. function names like |+| are not allowed.

2. Execute ./runAll.sh

The results are written to Results/Runs
