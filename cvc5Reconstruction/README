This is the set-up to test the reconstruction of cvc5 proofs in Isabelle.

Instructions:

0. Update file paths in config if necessary 

1. Copy all benchmarks into Benchmark/Input
   The directory can contain subfolders

3. Run ./scripts/preproc.sh
   This will sort out all benchmarks that have '(set-info :status unsat)'. Then, it runs cvc5 on them without proof production and a timeout of 1s. If cvc5 times out the benchmark will also be deleted.

To avoid using two much memory (and overwhelming Isabelle) steps 5 & 6 can be run on batches. If you want to do so you'll have to fill the file in step 4

4. ls Benchmark/Preprocessed > Benchmark/logRun.txt
   That's where the script documents which benchmark it still needs to process

5. Run ./scripts/getProof.sh 50
   This will run cvc5 on 50 of the preprocessed benchmarks and create proofs for them. Proofs and problems will be stored in Benchmark/Result

   a. For each problem.smt2 two files called problem_rewrite.smt2 and problem_rewrite.alethe will be generated.
      The proof has fine-grained rewrite steps

   b. For each problem.smt2 two files called problem_without_rewrite.smt2 and problem_without_rewrite.alethe will be generated.
      The proof has fine-grained rewrite steps

   c. veriT proof (turned off by default)
      For each problem.smt2 two files called problem_verit.smt2 and problem_verit.alethe will be generated.

5. Run ./scripts/checkProof.sh
   This will use Isabelle to check the proofs

You can run several tests:
